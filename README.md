<h1>Fantasy Football Collaboration Programs 2016 season</h1>
<br />
<p>This repo will host the shared programs used to retrieve and analyze data for the Fantasy Football league</p>
<p>Information about the Python Programs</p>
<ul>
	<li><u>nfldataretieval</u> Sorry for the misspelling - This uses the python package NFLGame to get schedules and statistics</li>
	<li><u>data_retrieval_from_api</u> - Uses the nfl.com api directly to get all of the statistics available on the site
</ul>
<p>Information about the R Programs</p>
<ul>
    <li>Clean Up Data.r - This cleans up the all stats file (there are duplicates in the file) and calculates the game level fantasy points for each player for each week in the seasons between 2013 and 2015</li>
</ul>
